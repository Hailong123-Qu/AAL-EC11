# EC-11 Rotary Encoder Helper Library

This is a little helper class that allows to work with EC-11 style of rotary encoders on Arduino. The dependancy on Arduino functions is very small though, so it can be easily ported on other platforms. See `ec11.hpp` for the docs and `examples` foler for a little demo.
